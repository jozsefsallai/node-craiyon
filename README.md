# node-craiyon

Unofficial Node.js API client for [Craiyon][craiyon-url] (formerly DALL-E Mini).

## Getting Started

Install the module using npm:

```
npm install craiyon
```

or Yarn:

```
yarn add craiyon
```

## Basic Usage

```js
const { Client } = require('craiyon');

const craiyon = new Client().withApiToken('your_api_token');
const result = await craiyon.generate({
  prompt: 'Painting of a dachshund drinking water in the style of Van Gogh',
});
```

You can then use any of the methods available in `result` to get the generated
images in any way you want.

You can learn more about the supported methods in the [documentation][docs-url].

## Customization

By default, the library will retry a request 3 times if something goes wrong.
You may change this behavior either by instantiating the client with a custom
number of maximum retries (for all generations):

```js
const craiyon = new Client().withMaxRetries(5);
```

or by setting a custom number of retries for a specific generation:

```js
const result = await craiyon.generate({
  prompt: 'Painting of a dachshund drinking water in the style of Van Gogh',
  maxRetries: 5,
});
```

## Older Versions

The package contains API clients for older versions of the Craiyon API. You can
use them by importing the corresponding `Client` class:

```js
const { ClientV2 } = require('craiyon'); // for v2
const { ClientV1 } = require('craiyon'); // for v1
```

The methods are more or less the same as in the latest client. Check the library
[documentation][docs-url] for more information.

## Notice

Please note that this is using a reverse-engineered backend endpoint provided by
Craiyon. The endpoint could, at any point in time, change the request and/or
response, or become unavailable for public use altogether. If you encounter any
problems with the library, please open an issue on [GitHub][github-issues-url].

## For Contributors

`node-craiyon` is written in TypeScript, therefore, you have to compile it to

command:

The library does not currently employ any unit testing measures, however, if you
would like to contribute to the library, please make sure that your changes pass
